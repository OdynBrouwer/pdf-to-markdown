"""Optional progress reporting for the CLI.

The pipeline itself never imports ``tqdm``: :class:`pdf2md.converter.PdfToMarkdown`
only calls an opaque ``progress(stage, done, total)`` callback, so library users
pay nothing and the MIT-only core stays free of UI dependencies.

This module supplies the tqdm-backed implementation used by the CLI. It degrades
to silence (no bar, no error) when tqdm is not installed - install it with
``uv sync --extra progress`` - or when stderr is not a terminal.

Every step of the pipeline reports itself through one callback::

    progress(stage, done, total)

``total > 0`` is a per-page step (``done`` of ``total`` pages finished) and gets
a bar. ``total == ONE_SHOT`` is a one-off step with nothing to count, so it gets
a single status line instead. Either way no step runs invisibly.
